    "It has been a pleasure working with Sharad. In the ~9 months time, I have seen him improve significantly as a developer and his contributions to the team has increased the productivity of the team. Working in a startup environment requires working extended hours, sacrificing weekends for work, meeting steep deadlines and a lot of patience to fix all the issues raised at the last moment before a feature release and Sharad is built for such a Job. Picks some of the complex tasks as well and manages to stick to the strictest deadlines. He has an excellent work ethics and good communication.",
